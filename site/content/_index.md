    One of our current projects is a food pantry in the San Carlos Community
    Center. The project was started in December of 2012 and will go through
    December 2013.



    We are also in the process of starting a non-profit in Mexico. The plan is to start an orphanage in Nuevo Progreso/Las Flores in memory of Regina Olivares, who died in Mexico in 1935. She left behind three daughters that had to fend for themselves, the youngest being 2-year-old Marina Graciela Garza Olivares. The motivation for the orphanage in Mexico is to help children who otherwise would not have the support of a safe environment and for an education, including college.

    In addition to helping humanity, we have ventured toward helping man's best friend. We have seen that there is a great need for animal rescue, along with spaying and neuturing those unfortunate animals left to fend for themselves. We recently received a Pet Adoption Partnership Grant through PetSmart and are applying for grants to aid in spaying and neuturing animals in Mexico.
